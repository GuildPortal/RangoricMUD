RangoricMUD
===========

A browser based MUD

Goals:
One Website, Many Possible Games.
Each game can be a shared world, or a "single player" world.
Each game can have its own set of rules.
It can be played in a browser, on a tablet or desktop, although native applications can be made using PhoneGap or something similar. Playing by phone will be considered, but not as much as tablet/desktop.

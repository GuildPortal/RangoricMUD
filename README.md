RangoricMUD
===========

A browser based MUD

Project Goals:
- One Website, Many Possible Games.
- Each game can be a shared world, or a "single player" world.
- Each game can have its own set of rules.
- It can be played in a browser, on a tablet or desktop, although native applications can be made using PhoneGap or something similar. Playing by phone will be considered, but not as much as tablet/desktop.

Rule Goals:
- Flexible, and straightforward.
- Some will be choices (1d20+Bonus vs Dice Pool) others will be additive (Abilities)
